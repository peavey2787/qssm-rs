# Assumptions and Model Boundary

## Current In-Tree Assumption State

At the current May 2026 checkpoint, the EasyCrypt `*.ec` files under this directory contain no named `axiom` declarations.

That does not mean the formalization is final. It means the current proof tree is closing on a deliberately exact-zero model rather than on open in-tree axioms.

## Budget Model Today

The budget surface currently lives in `primitives/BudgetParameters.ec` and is concrete:

| Budget | Current value | Meaning on the active model |
|---|---:|---|
| `epsilon_ms_hash_binding` | `0%r` | MS1 hash-binding gap on the current stage law |
| `epsilon_ms_rom_programmability` | `0%r` | MS2 ROM-programming gap on the current stage law |
| `epsilon_le_rej` | `0%r` | LE rejection component gap on the current shadow lane |
| `epsilon_le_fs` | `0%r` | LE FS component gap on the current shadow lane |
| `epsilon_le` | `epsilon_le_rej + epsilon_le_fs` | Umbrella LE budget consumed by theorem-facing arithmetic |

These are exact values in the current model, not placeholders. The caution is that the current model is still structurally simplified enough that those exact values are all zero.

## What the Zero Budgets Depend On

The current zero-budget path depends on the present semantics of the lower surfaces.

- The MS1 and MS2 paths close because the current lower stage laws collapse by exact equality on the active probability surface.
- The theorem-facing LE rejection endpoint routes through a semantic shadow lane whose failure quantity is currently zero on the active carrier.
- The theorem-facing LE FS endpoint also routes through a semantic shadow lane whose failure quantity is currently zero on the active carrier.
- The umbrella LE theorem path is therefore the additive composition of two exact-zero component endpoints.

## ROM, Rejection, and FS Semantics

### ROM / MS

The MS theorem path is currently modeled with a concrete exact-zero budget surface. The relevant question is no longer whether a repo-local ROM axiom remains in-tree; it does not. The real open issue is whether a future refinement should replace the exact-zero stage equalities with a nontrivial ROM-programming model and a derived nonzero budget.

### LE Rejection

The theorem-facing rejection endpoint is already routed through a lower semantic shadow lane. On the current carrier, that lane still collapses to zero failure probability, so the rejection component budget stays at `0%r`.

### LE FS Programming

The theorem-facing FS endpoint is also already routed through a lower semantic shadow lane. The active shadow model is still exact-zero, and the next missing local theorem is the support-aware good-branch collapse needed to make the shadow bad-event semantics nontrivial without disturbing theorem-facing names or the global LE arithmetic.

## What Is Still Assumed Outside the Formal Tree

Even with `0` named in-tree axioms, the overall result still relies on external boundaries:

- trust in the EasyCrypt checker and standard library foundations
- trust in the human mapping from the Rust implementation and protocol specs into the EasyCrypt model
- trust that the current exact-zero abstraction is an intentional staging model rather than the final desired semantic boundary

## How Future Assumptions Should Reappear

If nontrivial budgets or external assumptions are reintroduced later, they should be added in the narrowest honest place.

- Keep theorem-facing names stable where possible.
- Prefer lower semantic surfaces and proved bridge theorems over top-level wrappers.
- Centralize budget ownership in `primitives/BudgetParameters.ec` or another explicit owner rather than scattering assumptions through theorem-facing files.
- Prefer derived formulas or lower failure bounds over opaque budget parameters.
